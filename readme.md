How to use it in you project:

1. Copy the scss folder from the project files into your project files.
2. Set it up to where your sass compiler compiles this folder too.



Configuring or making Changes:

All spinners are configurable. Any changes like width, height, colors, border etc can be made by accessing the _variables.scss file and making changes to the defined variables.
